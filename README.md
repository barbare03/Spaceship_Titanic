# Spaceship_Titanic
This project predicts whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly

# Project Overview
This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanicâ€™s collision with a spacetime anomaly. The model is trained on personal records from the ship, including features like age, cryosleep status, VIP service, and amenities usage. The model is evaluated on the test set, and a CSV submission file is generated for scoring on Kaggle.

# Requirements
The project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
sklearn
If you are running this on Google Colab, make sure to mount Google Drive to access your datasets and save your submission file.

# Dataset
The data used is from the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). Place the train.csv and test.csv files in your Google Drive, under My Drive/Colab Notebooks/.
